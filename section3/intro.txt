react make building complex, interactive, user interfaces simpler

components - combination of HTMl code, CSS code for styling and some JS code for Logic

why components??
resuability
seperations of concerns
split large chunk of code into smaller pieces

How is components build??
combine the component of HTML, CSS and JS together

declarative approach - we don't tell the react to add certain elements should be created and inserted in a specific place 


JSX - stands for JS XML code, it is HTML code inside of javascript
