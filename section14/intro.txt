alternative to function

class-based components - define component by using class, uses a render method which define the-to-be-rendered output, was required in past can't use hooks 


props don't work in class based components instead we have to import Components from react

after importing the Component we can access the props through this.props


NOTE: class based component work together with functional based component


class based component lifecycle - 
componentDidMount() - built in method which we use as soon as we extend the built in components which we import from react, react call this method when the component was just mounted


componentDidUpdate() - called when we updated something in the component

componentWillUnmount() - called before component is unmounted/ removed from DOM
